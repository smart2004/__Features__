DT-RING & DT-RING+ pool technology.

Industrial Ethernet pool technology allow to overcome limit, connected to typical Ethernet topology, that has 'star'-form or 'tree', 
to prohibit use of loops.
In classic Ethernet networks does not allowed to have several ways of data transfer between two endpoints, as it may lead to broadcast storm and 
whole network inactivity.
However with use of pool technology in Industrial Ethernet it became possible to have redubdant communication path for reliability & fault tolerance
provision.

There implemented DT-RING & DT-RING+ pool technologies in Kyland switches, theese allow to create networks with excess connections in 'ring' topology
with time interval of 50ms for switchng from the main communication channel to backup channel.


DT-RING/DT-RING+ protocol features:
- All switches in one ring should have equal domain name;
- It's not required for various domains to have different names;
- Every ring should has only the master and several slaves;
- It could be adjusted for ring via two ports only;
- It may to adjust not more than pool couple ports in one ring;
- It could be adjusted only a pool port for one ring;
- DT-Ring-Port & DT-Ring-VLAN unable to use together.
